# For the second stage, you will need to develop
# an animal printer. Your program should display
# the animal identified in the code field.
#
# Please, don't remove the r character at the
# start of the code template. It's a part of the
# string and it's important. So, the string
# should start with r""" sequence. This “r” at
# the beginning stands for “raw” and allows
# various characters to be used in a string
# without escaping. For instance, “\” in a
# non-raw string should be escaped as
# follows: “\\”.
